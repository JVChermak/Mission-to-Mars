# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of the Project
Create a web app to display articles, images and imformation about Mars by scraping data from the NASA website. The following tasks were done to complete the project.
1. Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and scrape NASA's top article and featured image, Space-Facts table of information and four USGS high-resolution images.
2. Use a MongoDB database to store data from the scrape.
3. Create a Flask app to display the data from the scrape.
4. Use Bootstrap to style the app, including a carousel for the high-resolution images.
